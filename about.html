            <p class="text">We know you guys needed more NBA excitement so we're back! This time we wanted to find out which teams were, are, and will be the biggest dissapointments or biggest achievers in past and future seasons.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">After an NBA season ends there is an off season filled with speculation of who will be taking home next years ring. Questions of which team looked like real contenders after coming up short and which super-teams of today are looking like falling
                dynasties tomorrow.
            </p>
            <hr>So for this project we decided to train a model to tell us which who were real and who was an impostor. We found the model to be pretty critical of most teams but since there can only be one champion each season we don't mind the model hating
            on a few middle of the road organizations. Thank you for stopping by to check out our data!
